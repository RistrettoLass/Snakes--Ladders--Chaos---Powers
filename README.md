# Snakes, Ladders, Chaos & Powers
## A variation of the classic board game designed to give the Players more power over the game.
### Introduction

Snakes and Ladders is a very deterministic board game. SLC&P seeks to solve this issue by creating an entirely new environment that reshapes the classic game.

### Features Planned:
* Character Archetypes, each with unique pros and cons.
* 	* Special moves, useful once per board.
* Biomes that affect the utility of your chosen archetypes.
* Traps and Obstacles that block the board, reshuffle it, or otherwise cause a nuisance to you. 
* Duelling
